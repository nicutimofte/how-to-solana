How to Solana — Chapter 1: Lending & Borrowing
==============================================


**Overview**
============

Solana DEX & AMM products are the essential interfaces for further composability & complexity within Solana’s DeFi service suite. After familiarizing oneself with these decentralized commerce platforms, users will often wonder whether more can be done with their capital than simply earning fees from a liquidity pool. Despite continuous processing of massive quantities of on-chain transactions, Solana’s negligible transaction fees are often not lucrative enough for users to be satisfied with simply staking their assets, especially not for single digit APYs.

**Solana Lending & Borrowing**
==============================

After becoming comfortable with pooling and transacting on Solana, lending & borrowing become the next primitives that users tend to experiment with. **Lending & borrowing protocols are essential infrastructure for many sophisticated financial instruments that Solana is particularly well-suited to offer**. Categorically, Lending & Borrowing fall into the more general suite of prime brokerage services, many of which are not offered to retail TradFi investors. These services include:

*   Securities lending
*   Custodial services
*   Leveraged trade execution
*   Cash management
*   Structured products
*   Synthetic products (e.g. swaps + others)
*   Direct market access

**Prime Brokerage on Solana**
-----------------------------

Solana’s Lending & Borrowing services are accessed by **bridging funds onto the network and depositing assets as collateral.** Next, that **supplied collateral can either be lent out or used to borrow below a specified maximum “Loan-To-Value” threshold, as defined by the protocol.** Given the volatility and unpredictability of markets, undetected exploits & black swan events, protocols that do not adequately mitigate risk, generally do not stay solvent for long, often leading to bankruptcy. To avoid this, **overcollateralization is the most straightforward framework for universal access** to trustless prime brokerage services.

One of the key roadblocks for these extremely promising, yet somewhat impractical platforms are **overcollateralization ratios that are often fixed, and quite high** (150% and up). Due to the technical barriers of transmitting plentiful and precise real-time oracle data feeds on chains with comparatively lower throughputs compared to Solana (~50,000 tps & 400ms block times), **Solana-based lending protocols accommodate much more capital efficient and flexible collateralization ratios, given proportional liquidity onboarding.**

Solana’s lending/borrowing operations are divided into **several key primitives & themes** throughout the chapter. Several demonstrative examples will be given, to illustrate the capabilities of trustless prime brokerage on Solana.

**Primitive I: Supplying Liquidity & Generating Yield**
=======================================================

**Objectives:** Trustless Prime Brokerage
-----------------------------------------

**Permissionless Lending | Compounding Revenue Streams**

*   Web3 Interfaces: Design, architecture & UI/UX naturally deviate across different platforms. Generally, upon entering the app, a user dashboard will be presented with a **“connect wallet”** button, alongside **supported markets & relevant liquidity + yield analytics.**

<img alt="" class="ef es eo ex w" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*8bS7bibyD2peYRkn" width="700" height="651"/>

**Solend’s** homepage displays all available markets, as well as critical analytics e.g on-chain liquidity, supply/borrow limits, and APYs

<img alt="" class="ef es eo ex w" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*oKO3PyxWjRbwtOOj" width="700" height="380">

**Anchor** Protocol’s dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of protocol analytics and all available markets on the dApp homepage. Users simply need to scroll down to view markets + real-time metrics & yields.

1\. Connect a **protocol compatible web-wallet** (e.g Sollet or Phantom) to enable Web3 functionality and pooling operations.

2\. Proceed with supplying liquidity, either by **depositing supported collateral**, or by **adding on to an existing liquidity pool.**

<img alt="" class="ef es eo ex w" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*FQE7Dos1c9WFnTa1" width="700" height="776">
<br>

<img alt="" class="ef es eo ex w" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*OO4U7a3tWslD1cEr" width="700" height="270"/>

Supplying liquidity to on-chain pools can be done with either singular cryptoasset (**Solend**, top), or multiple cryptoassets (**Oxygen**, bottom) deposits. Once liquidity is pooled, users can now explore and access trustless lending & borrowing services.

3\. Confirm that liquidity has been supplied by either looking up the transaction with a [Solana-native block explorer](https://explorer.solana.com/), or simply refresh the protocol dashboard for account updates.

<img alt="" class="ef es eo ex w" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*76Do3LKD3uxXk8bH" width="700" height="743"/>

4\. After depositing assets (10 SOL in this example), the **protocol will begin to generate yield for pooled assets, and allow users to borrow on-chain** from other lending peers of the network.

**\*Note:** Solana’s high tx throughput and <1 second block finality ensures minimal latency for setting up LPs. Therefore reliable native and third-party explorers, dashboards, and tools typically receive & update real-time data from oracle feeds within seconds or milliseconds.

**\*\*Note:** If the lending/borrowing platform is accessed through an IP address from a geographically excluded region, **transactions may be automatically rejected.** This does not result in a loss of funds, as the transaction is not transmitted nor confirmed by mainnet Solana validators.

**Primitive II: Permissionless Loans, Debt, & Credit**
======================================================

**Objectives:** Financial Leverage & Flexibility | Rapid Capitalization
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Transparent & Trustless Borrowing**

1\. Select a **supported asset to borrow against existing pooled collateral** (e.g stablecoins, ethereum, bitcoin) and the protocol will proceed to match a prospective borrower with a prospective lender.

2\. After selecting one’s asset of choice (USDC in this example), the protocol will permit borrowing quantities equal to or below the maximum borrow limit.

**\* Note:** Higher credit utilization inevitably increases probabilities of liquidations and principal loss.

<img alt="" class="ef es eo ex w" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/0*1T_0h-1kHtxKFvXU" width="700" height="650"/>

3\. After confirming the transaction on a supported web-wallet, the protocol dashboard (**Solend** in this example) will update balances and display the conditions of the loan.

**\*Note:** Users should monitor borrow utilization closely, as **liquidations are triggered automatically, and often without warning** once debt totals exceed the protocol’s defined limits.

4\. Now that the USDC loan is registered on chain, it will remain outstanding until repaid in full, with interest. Depending on the individual’s risk tolerance and time horizon, and as long as the loan remains sufficiently collateralized, one can flexibly adjust borrow utilization in accordance with market conditions.

<img alt="" class="ef es eo ex w" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*X9o4GMVw5Wx9cuml" width="700" height="809"/>

Once all outstanding balances have been repaid, users can decide whether to withdraw pooled liquidity and allocate funds elsewhere, or simply earn yield passively by providing liquidity to the protocol.

<img alt="" class="ef es eo ex w" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*Bzr6avWKkry8x6a0" width="700" height="718"/>

**\*Note:** As SOL is already the main unit of account on the network, prospective borrower demand is typically much higher for stablecoins. Hence, passive SOL yields are also comparatively low.

**Solana Supported Services I: Cross-Collateralization**
========================================================

**Objectives:** Portfolio Flexibility | Account Stability
---------------------------------------------------------

**Risk Mitigation | Balance Sheet Diversification**

<img alt="" class="ef es eo ex w" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*KaJQNieXM3UKY2N5" width="700" height="531"/>

Cross-Collateralization on **Oxygen** is possible with both large established pools, and small custom pools. Regardless of existing liquidity, Serum’s on-chain order book matching ensures that all supported assets are priced accurately, with near instantaneous updates to price-feeds & analytics.

*   Cross-collateralization facilitates **the borrowing of one portfolio against another**, reducing the likelihood of liquidation and greatly increasing portfolio stability.
*   High-throughput, low-latency chains like Solana allow for **increasingly precise, real-time risk mitigation**; supporting **lower overcollateralization ratios** and **more** **diverse balance sheets**.
*   Solana’s negligible fees and confirmation times enable far more practical & flexible cross-collateralization applications for lending & borrowing. Compared to the deposit or income thresholds required for institutional prime brokerage, **0.1 Sol is more than sufficient to pool, lend, and borrow on-chain, dozens of times over.**
*   Solana’s on-chain versatility is indispensable in the development of more advanced protocols capable of **minimizing the existing user tradeoffs** in decentralized capital allocation such as **portfolio flexibility versus suboptimal yields**.
*   Eventually, once users can freely lend & borrow across varied and volatile markets, without incurring significantly lower yields or higher interest rates, protocols that can truly challenge the monopoly of CeFi prime brokerages can emerge.

<img alt="" class="ef es eo ex w" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1316/0*36umtGQDzewbzw3e" width="658" height="802"/>

**Solend** also supports cross-collateralization. Even relatively small accounts with <$100 deposits will have full functionality & flexibility in accessing the protocol’s suite of products & services.

**Solana Supported Services II: Liquidity Networks**
====================================================

**Objectives:** Staking Liquidity & Utility | Network Security Increased Staking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Yields | Increased Borrow Limits**

<img alt="" class="ef es eo ex w" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/0*0iSkuL4iS_ZS2sle" width="700" height="343"/>

Staking pools often compete rather than collaborate for liquidity. In this example, three independent validators are hosting three non-cooperative pools, presumably with three different SPT tokens. Source: [https://gopartyparrot.medium.com/what-is-psol-and-why-it-helps-staked-sol-tokens-60a0b00ac5d6](https://gopartyparrot.medium.com/what-is-psol-and-why-it-helps-staked-sol-tokens-60a0b00ac5d6)

*   Liquidity Networks are a **collaborative approach to increase the utility of staked assets** (SOL in this context) locked in individual staking pools.
*   Usually these staking pools will have their own mintable stake pool token (SPT) e.g mSol, pSol, stSol which serves the straightforward purpose of granting extra liquidity, **proportional to the users’ value locked** (often very overcollateralized).
*   Although the minting of SPT tokens are a more sophisticated means of acquiring liquidity from locked capital, especially compared to fixed staking APYs, **fragmented SPTs are still a suboptimal arrangement for unlocking maximum utility.**
*   Consider dozens of staking pools with independent TVL figures and corresponding SPT tokens. **These pools could unlock far more favorable lending/borrowing terms if collective SPT liquidity was composable & shared, as opposed to fragmented & standalone.**
*   As a network like Solana adds more mainnet validators in pursuit of greater decentralization, **composable services with proper incentives are essential** in maximizing the number of **collaborative, good actors** on the network.
*   One of these composable services is Parrot, a hub for depositing the various different SPT tokens in order to mint a single SPT token (pSol) with **greater utility, and more favorable borrowing terms** that result in **combining TVL from fragmented SPT networks.**
*   Liquidity networks are a service with many viable architectures. Solving for optimal incentivization parameters is an often complex and unintuitive problem at best, and an impossible one at worst. Solana’s capital efficiency certainly makes unifying an ecosystem with hundreds or thousands of SPTs more practical, however only time will tell which solutions work best.

<img alt="" class="ef es eo ex w" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*oMUUQa-DV6eN0Me0" width="700" height="350"/>

**Parrot** protocol functions as a hub for depositing rogue SPTs. Independent staking pools can combine liquidity by minting Parrot’s pSOL SPT token. The corresponding increase in TVL rewards pSOL minters with increased utility, better APYs, and more lenient overcollateralization requirements compared to the user’s original SPT deposit.
